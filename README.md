Documentation for how to work the night shift! 🌚

# So you're on the night shift...

Here's a rundown of all the things I've done/seen/realized while working when the stars come out to play ✨

#### Getting started

Aim to be at the office no later than 3:30 pm. I've found that's the ideal time because you should be monitoring slack until 11:30 pm, even if you've already commuted home. Don't come in any earlier than 2:30 pm. Seriously, you don't need to.

**First things first:** When you get into the office, check with Tim (or another assignment editor) if you're working a weekday. On the weekend, check in with the person on the day shift. The day shifter goes to the morning meeting and will usually have already communicated with the editor on call.

Either the editors or the person on the day shift will know what's running in the paper the next day. But sometimes, they won't. We'll get to that.

**Once you have a better grasp on what's happening**, knock a few quick things out:
  1. Schedule a tweet using [Social Flow](https://www.socialflow.com/publish#) for between 3:30 and 4 pm. You can set it to `Optimize` and `Must send` within 30 minutes. Chances are, the twitter has gone stale _especially_ if it's Saturday. Send a single tweet out just to give yourself 2 more hours time to get things done. Use Social Flow's default option to shorten the url, whether or not it's already shortened, to enable tracking. To include images in your tweets, take a screenshot from your Macbook.
  
  2. Update the homepage in [PageBuilder](https://washpost.arcpublishing.com/pb/admin/app/browse/pages.html). Go to `Home Page > Visual Stories - for Homepage`. We have slots 2 and 3. Go ahead and open [Trello](https://trello.com/b/loxfgmVV/graphics-docket) and look at the column "Flag for Viz Slots." You'll need it. So, you can update the hp in two ways: **Option 1.** If the slots are filled with content that is still very relevant _or_ we just don't have that much to choose from in the trello, look at the sidebar for `main-content`. Hover over the three line icon and swap our two slots. Super simple. Then `preview commit > stage and publish` (so long as everything looks right). **Option 2:** Choose a slot to edit by hovering over it and clicking the ✏️ icon. Pause and  Choose one that either hasn't been on the homepage in a while or is relevant to the news. Grab the URL and throw it in the [Graphics App to Methode Finder](http://newsapps.washpost.com/modlib/graphics-finder/). You need the **Methode URL**. Once you have that, add go back to PageBuilder and look for the `Path` field. Paste the Methode URL. Press update (this won't update the homepage yet). Navigate back to the page editor then same thing—`preview commit > stage and publish`. That's it!

**Don't forget, you're basically an editor right now.** If it's Saturday, you need to attend the 5 o'clock meeting. Tim Curren runs the meeting. You'll be asked how you like the front page and walked through the other section fronts. People will generally just agree that it looks good. Then, at the end, they'll go through things they're thinking for tomorrow's paper. Take notes. Ask about graphics if you need to.

Now, back to print graphics. Take the list of graphics you got from the editors or day shifter with a grain of salt and do some investigating of your own. Quickly scan trello for slugs then check a few places to get a better lay of the land on what's actually running (though, hopefully, it's what you already know about). Places to look:
1. Slack: Look in `#booking` and `#mpeds`. These channels will be your best friends on the night shift. Booking has the designers and MPEds has the copy editors. They talk a lot, and these channels often overlap with the same content.
2. [Slugger](http://toolbox.washpost.com/slugger/): This has all the MPEd assignments for the paper. Do a quick scan to find out both who is editing the stories you have graphics for and to find out if there are things booked with matching graphic slugs that you didn't know about.
3. [Methode](https://methode.washpost.com/vpn/index.html): **Method 1:** Check the paper layout `File > Quick Open > WP-YYYYMMDD-Daily.prp`. It's always the last file in the list and don't foget to always check **read only**. Use the `+` to navigate to the A Section and try to find anything with a chart symbol in place. Those have abotu a 33% of being from our team. Right click and open read only to investigate further. **Method 2:** Check the topic plan `Topics > Browse Topic Plans`. You can easily see all the slugs that _could_ run. You should do both to keep all your bases covered.

For each graphic, you'll need to:
1. Send to the MPEd for the story. You'll find them in `#mpeds` or on Slugger. If it's explicitly mentioned on the Trello card you _can_ skip this step but otherwise, it's good just in case. Just send a nice little message with a screengrab over Slack. They'll request if they want to review the graphic sent in a different way. Generally, they don't. Make the changes and reupload to Methode.
2. Check for rich black. Open the file (they could be in Methode, they could be in Dropbox. Sometimes, it's a mystery!)  You can check by selecting black text then going to `Select > Same > Fill and Stroke`. Then you'll be able to quickly see what the graphic is using. Another awesome shortcut is `File > Print`, changing the printer to `Adobe PS File` and (in the sidebar) `Output > Mode: Separations`.
3. Check the print layout to make sure **1.** the graphic isn't cut off and **2.** the graphic is in the right colorscale. Same way as before, `File > Quick Open > WP-YYYYMMDD-Daily.prp` etc. When you look at the page it's running on from the overview, you can see little boxes that'll indicate whether it's a color or black and white page. If it's in color, you're good. If it's in black and white, you'll have to bring it into illustrator and convert it. To quickly do so, go to `Edit > Edit colors > Convert to greyscale`. You'll probably have to mess around with it to make sure it looks good and you can differenciate things enough.

*Notes:*
* Get all the graphics finished as soon as possible. The first round of the paper usually closes around 8:30pm, so all things should be set by 7:30pm.
* [PDF](http://pdf/) is a helpful reference. Once the pages have closed, this'll show a pdf version of each page. You can use it to check how graphics look.

**So what if I see a story that matches a slug that _doesn't_ have a graphic in it?!**

Don't worry. Check in with the designer first. Find them in `#booking` or in [Skedder](https://newsplan.washpost.com/skedder/). That'll show what designer is working on each page, though sometimes it can get confusing. All else fails, just ask in Slack.

Offer the graphic(s) up to them. They don't _have_ to run it in print, but it's possible they didn't know about it espically if it wasn't in the package. If they want it, you might have to resize it and upload a new, print version for them. Always establish the amount of space you have (1 col, 2 col and pt. depth).

Chances are, if it's running in print, it's also already run on the web. Another mystery: if that's true. Quite honestly, I just google to see if the story is pubbed. Once you find it, make sure the graphic is in the story. If it's not, carefully add it. If it's in the normal template, just drag and drop to a slot at the bottom (generally the secondary slot, never the primary). If it's in the features template, drag and drop it where you see fit. For one column graphics, it should be put in as 296 width, for larger things, use the full with 600.

Don't forget to republish! `Tools > Actions > Check in`, then `Tools > Actions > Publish`.

If you can't get it or you're uncomfortable, just hit up `#homepage` for help.

**Wait, what about...**

**The Twitter?! (Again.)** Go ahead and queue tweets for the next 22 or so hours. They way the twitter won't sorely lapse. I send out the first one then go back and schedule a tweet for every couple of hours after (ignoring the hours between 10pm and 7am). That's about four or so tweets optimized for 6-8pm, 8-10pm, 8-10am, 11am-1pm. That gives the person on the next night shift time to do a similar queue schedule.

**Dinner?** If there's a bunch in the paper and I've been swamped, I wait until 8:30pm after the first round goes out but that's pretty late. If you've handled everything and things are chill, just have your phone and monitor slack while you grab food. Pretty much only fast food is available nearby after 7pm. I haven't ever eaten away from the office, but I do often go to away from my desk to eat like it's a normal shift.

#### Wrapping up

**Most importantly, when can I leave!?** Well, you can head out once a couple of things happen.
1. At minimum, the `RE` has to have gone out. For background, if you're not from print (like me): There's three rounds of the paper. The regional (RE), suburban (SU) and metro (M2). You'll see those referenced in slack a bunch in `#booking` and `#mpeds`. I try to stay until the `SU` has gone out, too, but that depends on the day and the amount of graphics running. The `RE` usually closes around 8:30, the `SU` around 10/10:30 and I have no idea about the `M2`.
2. You've sent the night note. This can be done around the first round of the paper getting sent out or right before you leave. Open Trello. The important columns are the `Published / Night note`, `Flag for Viz Slots` and `Watch for updates`. Any graphics that ran on the web that day should be in the night note. Make sure each trello card has at minimum: **1.** a cover photo, the description filled out with **2.** the story title and **3.** the story link. Any extra information can be moved to the comments. Those don't come through the night note. **Important**: make sure there is not a classic apps link in the description! The other columns should _hypothetically_ be fine since they run in the night note every night. To send the night note, go to Slack and scroll to your Apps. Search for `graphicsbot`. I always send a test to my email. Just type `test` and send. It'll give you feedback and send you a test night note. Check it and make sure all looks good. When you're ready to send, just type `send`. You're done!
3. If it's Saturday, you should send a weekend passoff note to the person working the weekend day shift, the person working the Sunday night shift (Usually Steck) and NEWS - Infographics Editors <graphicseds@washpost.com>. Super simple. Here's about what it should look like:

![passoff note](imgs/passoff.png)

Just include what went into print that day, what is left in the `Weekend` column of the trello and if you have any small notes, I include those, too. For example, if someone missed moving a graphic to published, just update the card with the correct information, move it to the bin and make a note so they know.

Head home but stay on call for emergancies.

**When do I fully sign off?** 11:30pm. It's late, I KNOW. But I generally leave the office between 10 and 10:30pm so by the time I get home, it's 11pm. Then I get ready for bed and check slack one more time at 11:30pm to make sure nothing's exploded and I call it a night.
